# A webapp template for making my personal projects easier
The template uses [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) as the backend, along with Socket.io to communicate between the client and the server, and [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) for frontend DOM manipulation.

The purpose of this template structure is to reduce the amount of my own initial legwork that I usually do on my own pet projects, and I couldn't find any generators online that suited my need, so I made one myself.
